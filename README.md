# formula1-sql-query
Experimenting with Python and SQL using a Formula 1 data set. Currently finds fastest and slowest pit stop time for a driver.

The user can either enter a 3 letter code or full name for a driver and script will return the fastest pit stop time and the slowest pit stop time for the driver.


I got all the CSV files used for this project from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020
